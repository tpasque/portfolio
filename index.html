    <p class="about-me-text">
      I am currently a developer in the full stack program learning and enjoying SQL, Express, Angular and Node.
      I am also an entrepreneur and small business owner. Prior to the full stack program at Galvanize I attended
      the University of Colorado where I received my engineering degree as well as a minor in economics. While at CU,
      I played on the CU Men's Rugby team as well as the Collegiate All-American Men's Rugby team.
      <br>After college I worked for a winery in a sales/management/marketing program. Shortly following the wine world,
      I worked at a start up energy engineering firm name Iconergy. While working at the Iconergy, I invested and started
      CrossFit Colfax which is located in Denver Colorado as well as a start up tech project that is still under way.
      I am recently married and live in Denver Colorado. <br> Professionally, I enjoy start up activity and the process of
      building something towards a common goal. I have worked at both large, medium and small companies and enjoy different aspects to each.
      I want to contribute to the technical effort at a company and if possible, I would like to contribute to the operations as well if needed."
